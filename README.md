# StereoWidener
Plugin to do stereo widening with decorrelation and panning.

Stereo widening widens the perception of the stereo image by boosting the surrounds and lowering the mid/side ratio. This plugin has controls for the stereo width in lower and higher frequencies, with a controllable cutoff frequency.
